<h1> My trip to Turkey!</h1>

<p>   My story in istambul and antalya turkey. My father was preparing bags with me and my siblings shirts and pants. 
I asked if we are gonna travel and my dad kept saying no. Finally I aksed my grandmother and she said that we were traveling to a secret place, "a suprise".
I thought that I was gonna go to italy because I always told my father I want to go to italy. At the time my mom came from kuwait to 
visit us because my parents were divorced anf I lived with my father. We only got to spend two days with her. My mother kept telling me that i am going to 
travel with my stepmother but I kept refusinf because I knew that she left use 1 year ago. We found her in the airport with us, How did my mother
know about my stepmother, since when did my mom like my stepmother? I asked my self.
I felt stupid for not beliving my mother. Finally I reached the airport and got to the check in, guess what, my passport was expired.
luckely I am old enough to travel by card. I finally reached istambul, turkey at midnight. I went to the hotel and slept. 
The next day i was watching people walking through the street and a guy wearing a bare costume or rabbit, it was hard to tell. We explored the area and then 
we went shopping in a very nice place, it was a small road made with bricks, on the side there were buildings and shops, also starbucks. We went to a 
resturant which had "kunafah" a national sweet for some former ottoman countries. The "kunafah" had ice cream on top which tasted nice. After that
we where in a taxi and we passed by a building which had my name on it, it was large. It turned out my name in turkish "yazan" means "in summer". 
We went into a place which had statues of celbrities and also old geniuses like albert einstein, also albert einstein was there. 
We went to a place which had the entire istambul made out of lego, it was huge. Me and my brother found lego boats which were remote controlled, we played 
none-stop until we had to go.

<h2> We went to antalya turkey! </h2>

<p> so now we cam to antalya it was really hot there, it felt like I was going to melt. My father took us into this huge hotel which had a swimming pool as
large as my house. it had small houses which had one floor, it was a square house. You needed a key to enter. We enterd while my father and stepmother were 
going around to explore the place, mw and my brother wtness a spider. When our parents finally came we told them all about what we saw. They said they will try
to find it and kill the next day. They didn't find it but I didn't care because I was enjoing the place. The place was clean, it smelled good, they had a free
ice cream stand. and two huge poools with slids. The pools are filled with people, turkish people. I also met a british guy there but I didn't get any of thier
contact information. and finally time to go back to istambul. </p>

<h3> back to istambul </h3>

<p> yes finally I am back in istambul. This time we went to a palace that belonged to an ottoman leader. Beside there was a mosque, I asked my dad if we can 
pray in that mosque, he said ok but we had to leave before prayer time. The mosque belonged to one of the ottoman leaders. I went to kidzania where the only thing
I did is play the flight simulator, I always mistake the throttle with the joy stick, I don't anymore. The final three days we just went shoping. We went to a mall 
where they had a lego store and inside there is a small "lego museum" I asume. I got a lego space ship that I can distroy and change it into a car or a space station
