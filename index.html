<h1> My trip to Turkey!</h1>

<p>   My story in istambul and antalya turkey. My father was preparing bags with me and my siblings shirts and pants. 
I asked if we are gonna travel and my dad kept saying no. Finally I aksed my grandmother and she said that we were traveling to a secret place, "a suprise".
I thought that I was gonna go to italy because I always told my father I want to go to italy. At the time my mom came from kuwait to 
visit us because my parents were divorced anf I lived with my father. We only got to spend two days with her. My mother kept telling me that i am going to 
travel with my stepmother but I kept refusinf because I knew that she left use 1 year ago. We found her in the airport with us, How did my mother
know about my stepmother, since when did my mom like my stepmother? I asked my self.
I felt stupid for not beliving my mother. Finally I reached the airport and got to the check in, guess what, my passport was expired.
luckely I am old enough to travel by card. I finally reached istambul, turkey at midnight. I went to the hotel and slept. 
The next day i was watching people walking through the street and a guy wearing a bare costume or rabbit, it was hard to tell. We explored the area and then 
we went shopping in a very nice place, it was a small road made with bricks, on the side there were buildings and shops, also starbucks. We went to a 
resturant which had "kunafah" a national sweet for some former ottoman countries. The "kunafah" had ice cream on top which tasted nice. After that
we where in a taxi and we passed by a building which had my name on it, it was large. It turned out my name in turkish "yazan" means "in summer". 
We went into a place which had statues of celbrities and also old geniuses like albert einstein, also albert einstein was there. 
We went to a place which had the entire istambul made out of lego, it was huge. Me and my brother found lego boats which were remote controlled, we played 
none-stop until we had to go.

<h2> We went to antalya turkey! </h2>

<p> so now we cam to antalya it was really hot there, it felt like I was going to melt. My father took us into this huge hotel which had a swimming pool as
large as my house. it had small houses which had one floor, it was a square house. You needed a key to enter. </p>
